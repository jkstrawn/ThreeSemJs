=================================
####with Jeremy Strawn and Breanna Turcsanyi

#####BEFORE YOU START
* Clone the repo (git clone https://github.com/jkstrawn/ThreeSemJs.git)

#####EXERCISES
1. Move the cube
  * Open IndexStart.html in your text editor. This is where we left off in the demo.
  * Move the cube along the y-axis
  * Move the cube along the z-axis
  * Rotate the cube about the y-axis
  * Rotate the cube the other direction
  * Rotate and move the block along an axis
  * Advanced: Start cube off the screen and have it move onto the screen

2. Add a second cube
 * Add a second cube (careful, make sure to move it's intial location so they aren't on top of one another!)
 * Make this new cube bigger
 * Advanced: Make cube1 move along an axis and cube2 rotate (hint: split the "update position" method into "rotate" and "slide")
 * Advanced2: Use Math.random() to randomize the cube's movement

3. Change the cube to a frog
  * In order to use the js loader, you must host your page.
  
      ###### On windows: 
      ###### On Mac: Brew install mongoose. Cd into the project and run mongoose from the cmd line. Open your browser to localhost:8080

     This will open index.html. You should see a frog on the page
   * Make the frog move (slide, rotate, both)
   * Add more frogs
   * Randomize their movements and starting points

4. Move the camera
5. Shoot the frog
